Proposal teams can spend weeks coordinating subject-matter experts, developing technical content, and preparing documentation—only to discover too late that the project was not well positioned to compete.</p><p><strong>An Objective Perspective</strong></p><p>We provide an independent assessment that helps teams look beyond internal enthusiasm and evaluate the opportunity based on evidence and strategic fit.</p><p><strong>Focused on Competitiveness</strong></p><p>Eligibility alone doesn't make an application competitive.

For major infrastructure, manufacturing, and growth projects, government-guaranteed debt, tax credits, matching funds, private investment, and other sources of capital may all play an important role in the overall capital stack.</p><p>Grant Management Associates helps organizations take a strategic approach to funding—identifying opportunities, strengthening funding readiness, and preparing for productive engagement with lenders, investors, and other funding partners.</p><p><strong>Understanding the Full Capital Stack</strong></p><p>Government-guaranteed debt is often an important part of the capital stack, particularly for large infrastructure and development projects. Grants can help fund a portion of a project, but matching funds and additional sources of capital are frequently required.</p><p>GMA brings extensive experience across the broader funding landscape. In recent years, GMA has secured approximately $500 million in infrastructure awards and $220 million in competitive tax credits, including support for a battery manufacturing project with a total project value of approximately $1.2 billion and the potential to create approximately 2,000 jobs.</p><p>Our role is to help clients understand how different funding sources can work together and develop a strategy that supports both immediate opportunities and long-term growth.</p><p><strong>Become Funding Ready Before You Approach Capital Providers</strong></p><p>Too often, companies approach lending institutions—including government agency debt lenders—before they are fully prepared to demonstrate their funding readiness, credibility, and capacity.</p><p>When critical documentation, financial information, project materials, or strategic plans are incomplete or outdated, an organization may make a poor first impression and ultimately be asked to return when it is better prepared.</p><p>GMA helps organizations strengthen their funding readiness before they enter those conversations. We work with clients to identify gaps, organize the information and documentation needed to support their funding strategy, and develop a clearer understanding of what they need to demonstrate to prospective funding partners.</p><p><strong>The goal is simple: help organizations enter important funding conversations prepared, credible, and strategically positioned.</strong></p><p><strong>A Strategic Partner in the Funding Ecosystem</strong></p><p>GMA serves as a strategic business and funding consultant, working alongside the broader network of professionals involved in complex financing and growth initiatives.</p><p>Depending on the needs of the engagement, we may collaborate with or support efforts involving:</p><ul><li>Lending institutions and government-backed financing programs</li><li>Broker-dealers and investment professionals</li><li>Venture capital and private investment partners</li><li>Attorneys and legal advisors</li><li>CPAs and tax advisors</li><li>Technical and industry specialists</li></ul><p>More than 200 of GMA's 500+ current and former clients have been early- to mid-stage companies. This experience gives our team a practical understanding of the challenges organizations face as they move from promising opportunities to investment-ready and funding-ready initiatives.</p><p><strong>Funding Strategy Beyond the Grant</strong></p><p>Securing funding is rarely about submitting a single application. Successful projects require a coordinated strategy that considers the full financial picture—from identifying opportunities and evaluating project readiness to securing grants, planning for matching funds, and preparing for conversations with lenders and other capital providers.</p><p>GMA helps clients connect these pieces into a more cohesive strategy.</p><p>Whether you are developing a major infrastructure project, expanding a manufacturing operation, pursuing a new technology initiative, or preparing your organization for its next stage of growth, our team can help you build a stronger foundation for pursuing capital.</p><p><strong>Let's Build Your Funding Strategy</strong></p><p><strong>Every funding journey begins with preparation and strategy.</strong></p><p>Talk with Grant Management Associates about your project, funding objectives, and the opportunities available to support your next stage of growth.</p><p><strong><a href="/contact" className="btn-primary inline-flex mt-4 mr-4 no-underline">[Discuss Your Funding Strategy] - CTA</a></strong></p>`

    bio: `<p>Kristin Cooper is a funding strategist and government affairs expert with over 30 years of experience helping organizations compete for and win federal, state, and foundation funding. She founded Grant Management Associates in 2009 with a clear mission: bring strategic intelligence to the grant funding process — not just good writing, but the analytical rigor to know which opportunities are worth pursuing and the methodology to win them.</p><p>Under Kristin's leadership, GMA has secured over $2.5 billion in funding for clients. She developed GMA's proprietary Key Considerations Analysis (KCA) methodology, which evaluates competitive positioning, organizational fit, and scoring criteria before a single word of a proposal is written. This "Go/No-Go" approach is why GMA's clients don't waste resources on lost causes — and why they win at an extraordinary rate when they do pursue.</p><p>Before founding GMA, Kristin served as a Full Professor at California State University, Chico's College of Engineering, where she directed grant-funded programs across five colleges. She was the founding director of CSU Chico's Environmental Resource Program and the Concrete Management Program. Kristin also served as a registered federal lobbyist, where she was instrumental in securing a $100 million line item in the Department of Energy budget.</p><p>Today, Kristin leads GMA's evolution into a funding intelligence platform — integrating AI-powered grant matching with decades of human strategic judgment. She oversees a team that spans defence, energy, infrastructure, agriculture, and workforce development — the sectors where federal dollars are flowing and where GMA's clients are winning.</p><h3>By the Numbers</h3><ul><li>$2.5 Billion in funding secured for clients</li><li>500+ client organizations served</li><li>30+ years of funding strategy experience</li><li>Pioneered the AI Grant Matching Engine for systematic opportunity identification</li></ul><h3>Kristin's Certifications & Professional Credentials</h3><ul><li>Certified Sustainable Development Practitioner | Association of Energy Engineers</li><li>Certified Professional Contracts Manager (CPCM)</li><li>Master Certificate in Concrete Fundamentals | Hanley Wood, World of Concrete</li><li>Green Building and Sustainable Design Certificate Program | UC Davis; Land Use and Natural Resources, and Business and Technology coordinated with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)</li><li>Sustainability Performance Metrics | Natural Logic, Short Course Certification on the selection and use sustainability performance metrics and incentives.</li><li>Special Certification in Environmental Justice | (Train the Trainer), United States Environmental Protection Agency</li></ul>`,

<p>In June of 2018, the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities (AHSC) competitive grant program through the state of California’s Strategic Growth Council (SGC) cited three types of projects that were recommended for funding. This Redding Block 7 Net Zero Housing &amp; Downtown Activation Project was the highest point-scoring project of its type in the state. This Integrated Connectivity Project (ICP) type had the highest number of competitive proposals (28) and Redding scored 88 out of 100 total points. In addition, Redding’s project proposal was recommended for the third largest dollar amount in the state, $19,959,536.</p>
<p>This winning proposal is for a mixed used development in downtown, offering housing and transportation amenities, such as completing the river trail connection from Turtle Bay Exploration Park to downtown, was a joint submission by K2 Land and Investment, LLC (K2), The McConnell Foundation (McConnell), the City of Redding, Shasta Regional Transportation Agency and Community Development and Revitalization Corporation (CDRC).</p>
<p>This 2018 grant award builds on the momentum for the revitalization of Redding already underway with the joint effort between K2 Land and Investment and the City of Redding. With grant writing support from GMA, these two entities were successfully awarded $20,000,000 also from the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program from the Strategic Growth Council in 2017.

<p>To be awarded two grants of close to $40M for the same region, one after the other, is unheard of. GMA is proud of their leadership in shepherding this through the notoriously difficult Strategic Growth Council process.</p>`

The program complied with the ANSI/IACET Standards and EUCI was authorized to offer IACET 1.0 CEUs for accreditation units. The attendees were from all sectors; start ups and large corporations.</p>
<p>Kristin Cooper managed the client interactions and delivered the training program. The content for the training program was provided by GMA with Client approval.</p>
<p>GMA generated all of the workshop content and materials. The content came from professional experience and case studies. The material was highly interactive. There was ample time for the participants to share information, obtain feedback and refine their work. GMA uses a lot of examples and gives students’ assignments to work on both separately and together. GMA also prepared handouts for the program to be reviewed concurrent to the session. The course was appropriate for beginners to intermediate writers.</p>
<p>After each section we would spend time actively writing components. Once completed we would review these materials as a group. All of the group members become “reviewers” of each other’s materials. From the session evaluations, this was the most important aspect of the training. After a few section reviews all of the students started to excel with their writing, both in content and transitions.</p>
<p>This training can be easily modified to meet multiple time frames. The feedback on the training was positive with negative scores for the temperate of the room. Many of the students followed up with questions directly with GMA after the workshop ended.</p>`
